**Project Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MtYe3YK0pC5bIZzj6fmRI1N02CX_q1Af?usp=sharing**

**Overview**

SignLink is an innovative web-based application designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and non-hearing communities. By combining advanced computer vision, machine learning, and a user-friendly interface, the application provides two core functionalities:

Translating hand gestures into English text.

Converting English text into sign language gestures.

This project addresses accessibility challenges and empowers seamless and inclusive communication in various settings, including educational, professional, and personal environments.

**Features and Working Mechanism**

  ![flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08dccb35-3ba7-4ad9-a8e4-32a12b06f5c0)

**1. Hand Gesture to English Conversion**
  
  **Technology:** Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize and analyze hand gestures in real time via webcam.
  
  **Gesture Recognition:** MediaPipe detects hand landmarks such as knuckles, fingertips, and joints, allowing for accurate recognition of unique spatial patterns.
  
  **Machine Learning:** Gestures are matched against a pre-trained dataset of sign language gestures, ensuring high accuracy and accounting for subtle variations.
  
  **Real-Time Feedback:** Recognized gestures are displayed as corresponding English letters. If no match is found, the system prompts the user for clearer input.

**2. English to Sign Language Conversion**

  **Input:** Users enter English text (letters or words) into the system.
  
  **Output:** The application displays images of sign language gestures corresponding to the input text.
  
  **Use Case:** Facilitates effective communication for individuals unfamiliar with sign language.

**3. Streamlit Interface**

  **User-Friendly Design:**  A dropdown menu allows users to switch effortlessly between gesture recognition and text-to-sign functionalities.
  
  **Real-Time Processing:** The system ensures minimal latency, providing smooth and accurate performance.
